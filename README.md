```bash
git clonne https://github.com/tiansemi/business_innov.git
cd business_innov
python -m venv ev
.\ev\Scripts\activate
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Node.js dependencies
cd expgainer
npm i

# Start backend server
cd ..
fastapi dev main.py
```

open new terminal and run 

```bash
# Start frontend (in a new terminal)
cd expgainer
npm run dev
```

### Workflows Configuration

The project includes pre-configured workflows:

### Publishing Your App

To make your app publicly accessible:

1. **Configure for Production**:
   - Go to the Deployments tab in your Replit workspace
   - Select "Autoscale Deployment" for automatic scaling
   - Configure your deployment settings

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in Secrets
   - The app will automatically use production settings

3. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy" to publish your application
   - Your app will be available at your deployment URL

### Configuration Files

- **`.replit`**: Defines run commands and port configurations
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies
- **`expgainer/package.json`**: Node.js dependencies

### API Endpoints

The backend provides these endpoints:

- `GET /`: Health check
